<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I always had a deep love for technology in general and I thought to myself 
  "imagine working with something related to this".
</p>

<p>I moved around a lot and decided to settle in Switzerland. 
  I simply felt in love with this culture and the nature here is UNBELIEVABLY gorgeous.
</p>

<p>But as the life normally don't go always in the pace that you want,
  untill this day I couldn't land a job in programming. I encountered inummerous walls on my way.
  One of them beeing my lack of German speaking skills.
</p>

<p>
  As often as I can, I try to make courses so I can be on hand with the latest trends in programming.
  Because you know how this actually works... If you stop it, you'll forget a lot of important things
  that is in fact fundamental to your daily life as a developer.
</p>

<p>
  So I'm starting this course with Dr. Yu to refresh all my knowledge in web development.
  And most important, I'm commited to watch all the videos from start to end. 
  Because you never know... you might actually learn something that you didn't know.
